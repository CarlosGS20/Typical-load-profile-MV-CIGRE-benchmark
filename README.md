# Typical load profile MV CIGRE benchmark

This document describes how to obtain the MV CIGRE network consumption data described in an article for use in power system research studies. The motivation for this repository is to describe a clear method for obtaining data to replicate articles or methods in a transparent way when data is difficult to find in database form. The procedure described is also applicable to other work where data is required and displayed on graphs. 

The first step is to identify the data to be collected. In this case, Figure 9 of the article ["Modelling and Optimization in Microgrids"](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/10/4/523), published in Energies by Tobias Porsinger, Przemyslaw Janik, Zbigniew Leonowicz, and Radomir Gono.
