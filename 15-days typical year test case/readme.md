# 15-days typical year test case


This directory contains:

- [Scenario](https://github.com/CarlosGS20/Typical-load-profile-MV-CIGRE-benchmark/tree/main/5-days%20test%20case/Scenario%20B): The objective of this scenario is to analyse the congestion problem in a scenario consisting of 15 representative days. The total number of days is divided into three periods: the transition season between winter and summer, five days of winter, and finally, five days of summer.
- Network parameters.

The test network used is shown in the figure below, with a modification for simplicity in the modeling: the substations are replaced by two branches, 0-1 and 0-12, whose parameters are defined in the network data.
