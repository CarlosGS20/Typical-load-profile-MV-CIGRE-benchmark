# 5-days test case

This directory contains:

- [Scenario A](https://github.com/CarlosGS20/Typical-load-profile-MV-CIGRE-benchmark/tree/main/5-days%20test%20case/Scenario%20A): The purpose of this scenario is to analyse occasional problems lasting a maximum of two hours.
- [Scenario B](https://github.com/CarlosGS20/Typical-load-profile-MV-CIGRE-benchmark/tree/main/5-days%20test%20case/Scenario%20B): The purpose of this scenario is to analyse the problem of congestion over a long period of time (9 hours).  
- Network parameters.

The test network used is shown in the figure below, with a modification for simplicity in the modeling: the substations are replaced by two branches, 0-1 and 0-12, whose parameters are defined in the network data.
